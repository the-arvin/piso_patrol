            1.  **Use an AI Assistant:** Use an AI like ChatGPT or Gemini with the `AI_ASSISTANT_PROMPT.md` file found in this app's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/AI_ASSISTANT_PROMPT.md).
            2.  **Log on the Go:** Simply send your AI assistant text messages (e.g., *"‚Ç±500 groceries at SM"*) or upload receipt photos.
            3.  **Export to Google Sheets:** The prompt instructs the AI to log everything and export it as a CSV-formatted text.
            4.  **Connect to this App:** Just paste that text into your connected Google Sheet, and your dashboard will update automatically.
            
            This turns your AI assistant into a data entry clerk, and **Cash Cohort** into your personal analyst.
